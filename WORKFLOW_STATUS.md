⚠ SAFETY NOTES

Running /api/auction-scheduler in production will charge real cards if:

• STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is live
• DISABLE_WINNER_CHARGES is false

Always test in Stripe TEST mode first.
Keep DISABLE_WINNER_CHARGES=true during lifecycle testing.
Admin routes are JWT-protected — never expose secrets client-side.
